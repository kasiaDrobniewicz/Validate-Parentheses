**Validate Parentheses**

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', here youâ€™ll need to try to determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is considered valid if:

   1) Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
   2) Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
